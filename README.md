This repo conatins input files for open source reservoir simulator GEOS (www.geosx.org) to simulate pressure and CO2 saturation distributions for 10 years of CO2 injection based on clastic shelf depositional environment. We also provide the python script for driving the GOES runs massively to build a training dataset for deep learning purpose. More details of the reservoir model and the simulation setup can be found at https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1750583622001839
